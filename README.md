# Programming Features

## Ammo Management
- Players start with a limited supply of ammo.
- Each shot fired depletes the ammo count.
- Ammo pickups are scattered throughout the level to resupply.
- Script `BulletScript.cs` handles the bullet behavior including instantiation and collision detection.

## Levels
- The game includes multiple levels with unique challenges and environments.
- Transition between levels is managed by `ScenesManagerScript.cs`, which handles scene loading based on player actions and progression.

## Continuing Progress
- Player progress, including collected recyclables and score, persists between level changes.
- `PlayerData.cs` keeps track of points and is not reset until the game is over, ensuring cumulative progress.

## Enemy AI
- Enemies detect player's proximity and engage in pursuit if the player tries to escape.
- The `enemyFollow.cs` script handles the AI behavior for seeking and attacking the player.

## Score Saving
- Scores are saved to a JSON file, `playerlist.json`, allowing players to keep a record of their achievements.
- `JsonWritter.cs` is responsible for writing the player's score to the file after each level completion.

## Health and Ammo Pickups
- Health and ammo pickups are available to replenish player resources.
- `HealthScript.cs` and `AmmoBoxScript.cs` control the behavior and effects of these pickups when collected.

## Animations
- Animated objects such as recyclable items and enemy reactions enhance the game's visual feedback.
- Scripts like `RecycledObjScript.cs` manage the animations and ensure they are triggered by in-game events.

## Sound
- A rich sound design includes background music, shooting effects, and audio cues for player actions and environment interaction.
- Managed within Unity's audio system, and scripts like `TrashScript.cs` control when to play certain sound effects.

## Progressive Destruction
- Enemies react to being hit with visual cues such as scaling down, indicating damage taken.
- The `Shooted.cs` script modifies enemy appearance progressively as they take damage with the ReduceScale() method, 

## Automatic Generation
- The game world dynamically generates enemies and pickups to maintain a consistent challenge and resource availability.
- `Generator.cs` and `R_Generator.cs` scripts manage the spawning of these game objects throughout the level.

Each feature is carefully crafted to create an engaging and dynamic gameplay experience. Scripts interact with Unity's physics, audio, and animation systems to bring the desert wasteland and its challenges to life
